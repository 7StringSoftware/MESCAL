/** \mainpage MESCAL

MESCAL is a JUCE module that adds Direct2D bonus features for JUCE 8.

https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE

MESCAL features:

- Mesh gradients
- Conic gradients
- Image effects
- Sprite batches

All of these features are processed in the GPU and work with standard JUCE objects such as Image and Colour.

In the long standing tradition of JUCE and JUCE modules, the name MESCAL is a somewhat silly forced backronym
that includes the author's name:

Matt's Enhancements for Shaders, Composition, Acceleration and Layering

Or it's just because I like mescal.

# Mesh gradient

A MeshGradient is a gradient defined by a set of vertices, each with a specific color. The gradient colors flow
according to the placement of the vertices, offering a more precise and flexible gradients than can be achieved 
with linear or radial gradients.

# Conic gradient

A ConicGradient is a gradient with colors that flow in an elliptical path around a center point. The gradient can fill
an entire ellipse, or just an arc segment.

# Image effects

The Effect class is a wrapper for built-in Direct2D image effects.

Effects can be chained together to create complex image processing graphs. For example, here's a knob image initially
drawn with standard JUCE graphics calls, then processed with lighting, shadow, and composition effects to create a 3D
metallic look. Effects are applied in realtime; note how the lighting and shadows change on the processed image as the
knob rotates.
