/** \mainpage MESCAL

MESCAL is a JUCE module that adds Direct2D bonus features for JUCE 8. 

https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE

MESCAL features:

- Mesh gradients
- Conic gradients
- Image effects
- Sprite batches

All of these features are processed in the GPU and work with stanard JUCE objects such as Image and Colour.

In the long standing tradition of JUCE and JUCE modules, the name MESCAL is a somewhat silly forced backronym 
that includes the author's name: 

Matt's Enhancements for Shaders, Composition, Acceleration and Layering

Or it's just because I like mescal.

# Mesh gradient

A mesh gradient defined by a set of vertices, each with a unique color. Mesh gradient colors flow smoothly between
the vertices across an image.

 # Conic gradient

 A conic gradient is a gradient with colors that flow in a circular path around a center point. The gradient can fill
 an entire circle, or an arc segment.

 # Image effects

 Direct2D has built-in image effects that can be chained into complex image processing graphs. For example, here's 
 a knob image initially drawn with standard JUCE graphics calls, then processed with lighting, shadow, and composition
 effects to create a 3D metallic look. Effects are applied in realtime; note how the lighting and shadows change on the 
 processed image as the knob rotates.
