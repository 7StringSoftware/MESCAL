/** \mainpage MESCAL

MESCAL is a JUCE module that adds Direct2D bonus features for <a href="https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE">JUCE</a> 8:

- Mesh gradients
- Conic gradients
- Image effects

All of these features are GPU-accelerated and work with standard JUCE objects such as Graphics, Image and Colour.

In the long standing tradition of JUCE and JUCE modules, the name MESCAL is a somewhat silly forced backronym
that includes the author's name:

<b>Matt's Enhancements for Shaders, Composition, Acceleration and Layering</b>

Or it's just because I like mescal.

Since these are Direct2D features, MESCAL only supports Windows.

# Mesh gradient

A MeshGradient is a gradient defined by a set of vertices, each with a specific color. The gradient colors flow
according to the placement of the vertices, allowing more complex and flexible gradients than can be achieved
with linear or radial gradients.

# Conic gradient

A ConicGradient is a gradient with colors that flow in an elliptical path around a center point. The gradient can fill
an entire ellipse, or just an arc segment.

# Image effects

The Effect class is a wrapper for built-in Direct2D image effects.

Effects can be chained together to create complex image processing graphs. For example, here's a graph that takes a
knob initially drawn with standard JUCE graphics calls, and feeds that image through lighting, shadow, and composition
effects to create a 3D metallic look. Effects are applied in realtime; note how the lighting and shadows change
as the knob rotates.
